Exploit for CVE-2008-2019 - Simple Machines Form (SMF) 1.1.4 and below.

A hamming distance calculation or levenshtein distance can be used to compare the pulse code modulation (PCM) from the orignal audio source to the composite generated challenge response of the audio captcha.  Using a hamming distance calculation to look for close matches based off of a static heuristic, a cut of a few hundred vs a few thousand is enough to determine the answer needed to solve the captcha challenge response.

A hamming distance calculation works here because the noise introduced by Simple Machine Form (SMF) was only flipping random bits,  insertions or deletions where not used.  A later revision of the captcha added short pauses to the PCM, these insertions of white space could be identified with levenshtein whereas even a small insertion would throw off a hamming distance calculation.
